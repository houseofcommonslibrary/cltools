\title{Create indices from columns in a dataframe given a baseline row or a vector
of baseline values}
\usage{
get_indices(data, from = 2, to = ncol(data), start = 100, baserow = 1,
  basevals = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing columns of numerical data to be
expressed as indices.}

\item{from}{The number or name of the column from which indices are
calculated. The default is 2, assuming one column for row labels. Use 1
if there are no preceding data columns.}

\item{to}{The number or name of the column to which indices are calculated.
The default is ncol(data), which means indices are calculated across all
remaining columms in the dataframe.}

\item{start}{The starting value for the baseline. The default is 100.
The start value must be a positive number greater than zero.}

\item{baserow}{The number of the row to be used as the baseline. The
default is 1. The baseline row must contain no zero values. This argument
is ignored if base values are set explcitly with \code{basevals}.}

\item{basevals}{Specifies the values to use for the baseline explicitly.
Use this if the baseline values to be used are not represented in any
given row. The default is NULL, which means the function will use the
values in the \code{baserow} instead. The baseline values must not
contain zeros.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing indices and any preceding columns.
}
\description{
Creates indices from a set of columns in a dataframe using a given row
number, or vector of values, as the baseline. Use \code{add_indices} to
append the indices to the input dataframe.
