\usage{
deflate(data, deflator, basepos = length(data))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data series to be deflated as a numeric vector}

\item{deflator}{The deflator series as numeric vector. The deflator series
must be the same length as the data series and must not contain either
NAs or zeros.}

\item{basepos}{The vector index of the baseline for the deflated series:
this equivalent to the period in which all prices will be expressed. The
default value is the index of the last value in the series i.e. the most
recent period.}
}
\value{
The deflated data series as a numeric vector.
}
\description{
