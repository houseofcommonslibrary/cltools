\title{Create real terms series from columns in a dataframe given a deflator
series and a baseline row and add them to the dataframe}
\usage{
add_real(data, deflator, from = 2, to = ncol(data),
  baserow = nrow(data), prefix = "rt_")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing columns of numerical data to be
expressed in real terms.}

\item{deflator}{The deflator series as numeric vector. The deflator series
must be the same length as the data series and must not contain either
NAs or zeros.}

\item{from}{The number or name of the column from which real terms series
are calculated. The default is 2, assuming one column for row labels.
Use 1 if there are no preceding data columns.}

\item{to}{The number or name of the column to which real terms series are
calculated. The default is ncol(data), which means real terms series are
calculated across all remaining columms in the dataframe.}

\item{baserow}{The number of the row to be used as the baseline for
calculating the real terms series. The default is the last row in the
dataframe, which is assumed to be the most recent period.}

\item{prefix}{A string prefix to add to the column names to identify their
index equivalents. The default is "ix_".}
}
\value{
A tibble containing real terms series and any preceding columns.
}
\description{
Creates real terms series from a set of columns in a dataframe using the
given row deflator series and the number of the row to use as the baseline
add adds them to the dataframe. The deflator series must have the same
length as the number of rows in the dataframe. If the deflator series is
already in the dataframe, then pass it into the function with
\code{data$deflator_column}. The deflator cannot contain NA or zero values.
