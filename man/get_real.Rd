\title{Create real terms series from columns in a dataframe given a deflator
series and a baseline row}
\usage{
get_real(data, deflator, from = 2, to = ncol(data), baserow = nrow(data))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing columns of numerical data to be
expressed in real terms.}

\item{deflator}{The deflator series as numeric vector. The deflator series
must be the same length as the data series and must not contain either
NAs or zeros.}

\item{from}{The number or name of the column from which real terms series
are calculated. The default is 2, assuming one column for row labels.
Use 1 if there are no preceding data columns.}

\item{to}{The number or name of the column to which real terms series are
calculated. The default is ncol(data), which means real terms series are
calculated across all remaining columms in the dataframe.}

\item{baserow}{The number of the row to be used as the baseline for
calculating the real terms series. The default is the last row in the
dataframe, which is assumed to be the most recent period.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing real terms series and any preceding columns.
}
\description{
Creates real terms series from a set of columns in a dataframe using the
given row deflator series and the number of the row to use as the baseline.
The deflator series must have the same length as the number of rows in the
dataframe. If the deflator series is already in the dataframe, then pass it
into the function with \code{data$deflator_column}. The deflator cannot
contain NA or zero values. Use \code{add_real} to append the real terms
series to the input dataframe.
